# olc::PixelGameEngine custom linux framebuffer platform

(using FBG lib from [https://github.com/grz0zrg/fbg](https://github.com/grz0zrg/fbg))

**WIP**

## BUILD PGE APP (linux with cmake)

You need to download and include olcPixelGameEngine.h yourself, place it in the root directory of this sample project
then:
```bash
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make
```

## TODO

- fetch olc::pge at build from OLC's repo
- remove fbg source code from project and use github repo as dependency
- testing a lot
